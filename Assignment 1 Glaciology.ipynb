However, only Grimsel Hospiz and Meiringen combine temperature and precipitation data, while Jungfraujoch provides only temperature. Therefore, the record would have to be combined with precipitation data from another station – which would lead to new uncertainties, taking into account elevation differences and how much precipitation varies even at small spatial scales.\n",
